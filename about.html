            What’s important is that you have a faith in people, that they’re
            basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they’ll do
            wonderful things with them. –Steve Jobs

          <p>Hello, welcome to my About Me page. Just call me Alex.</p>
          <p class="abt-me">
            I am is a highly self-motivated person who enjoys learning and
            taking on new challenges. For the past five years I have worked as a
            professional civil servant at the Ministry of Gender, Children and
            Social Protection Ghana. Within these years I have held the position
            of an Assistant Director at the Finance and Administration
            Department and the Social Protection Directorate for three and two
            years respectively. I have a proven record of successful
            implementation of initiative driven projects both at local and
            national level.

          <p class="abt-me">
            I have always been fascinated about the mouse, cursor and how web
            pages are created. My journey has been that of an experimental one,
            from changing values in chrome tools to actually installing my first
            code editors. The joy of imagining web designs, applications ,coding
            to add functionalities and most importantly making the lives of
            other people easier through your codes has kept me learning more
            every day. It has been challenging but very rewarding to see your
            code work to even 60% of your expectation
